					<ul>
						<li>Crescent roll dough – you can use canned crescent roll dough, or
							sheets of canned crescent dough. Either will work, the sheets of dough are simply a little
							easier to work with
							because you don’t need to press the crescent roll perforations together.</li>
						<li>Granulated sugar</li>
						<li>Brown sugar</li>
						<li>Ground cinnamon</li>
						<li>Unsalted butter – you’ll want the butter and cream cheese softened prior to making the
							recipe, so I recommend
							removing them from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before starting the recipe, so they
							can come up to room
							temperature.</li>
						<li>Pazazz apples – I purchased the apples at Vons in my area, click <a target="_blank"
								href="https://www.google.com/maps"> here</a> to find out where you can buy these
							sweet,
							tart and extra crispy apples in your area!</li>
						<li>Cream cheese</li>
						<li>Milk</li>
						<li>Vanilla extract</li>
						<li>Powdered sugar</li>

		<h3><strong>Step by step instructions</strong></h3>

				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>Roll out the crescent roll dough. Place a large piece of parchment paper on a flat work surface. Place
						both
						sheets of crescent roll dough slightly overlapping on the parchment paper and press the seams together to
						form
						one
						large crescent roll rectangle.</li>
			
						<li>Top with the cinnamon sugar butter. In a medium bowl, combine softened butter with granulated sugar,
						brown
						sugar
						and ground cinnamon. Spread this mixture evenly across the crescent roll dough.</li>
			
						<li>Add the apples. Core and thinly slice one Pazazz apple, then place the slices on top of the cinnamon
						sugar
						butter
						in an even layer, not overlapping. Overlapping the apples will make it difficult to roll up and form into
						the
						wreath.</li>
			
						<li>Roll it up. Roll the crescent roll dough up tightly over the apples and the cinnamon sugar butter into a
						tube.</li>
			
						<li>Slice it in half. Use a sharp knife to slice lengthwise through the middle of the cinnamon roll tube.</li>
			
						<li>Separate the two halves. Once you’ve sliced the cinnamon roll tube in half, separate the two halves, and
						make
						sure the cinnamon butter and apples are facing up on both halves.</li>
			
						<li>Braid them together. Carefully braid the two halves together, lifting one half over the other, then vice
						versa
						until it’s rolled up into one long braid.</li>
			
						<li>Form the wreath. Bring the two ends of the braid together to form the wreath, then transfer the wreath on
						the
						parchment paper over to a baking sheet. Bake at 350°F for 20-25 minutes, or until the entire cinnamon roll
						wreath is
						golden brown.</li>
